# The White Hall


Web applications especially Web apps are becoming very popular day by
day. Many people in Bangladesh are now interested to arrange programs in
community centers. There are a lot of community centers in Bangladesh and
many are launching their business. But none of them has their own web
applications. So, weâ€™ve decided to develop a web application for a
community center.<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). -->

## About This Project
Our application has features like checking the availability of the community
center for reservation, checking food packages offered by the community
center, admin can add food menu, updating food menu, admin account
creation, booking a day or evening slot, messaging, etc. There will be an
admin portal to confirm the booking and some other tasks and a payment
gateway to confirm booking money.
